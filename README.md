## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of 
skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an 
expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just 
learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts
that build on a theme.

**Preperation**

1. Install [Elixir => 1.5](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
2. Open a terminal and clone this repository.
3. Login with your account on the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) website.

**Solving a puzzle**

1. Go to the puzzle of the day you would like to solve.
2. Copy the **input** in your clipboard.
3. Run the corresponding script of the year and day and append the input data. The command should be in the form: `elixir year\day.exs input-data`, eg. for the year 2016, day 1 you should run the command:

```
elixir 2016\01.exs L1, L3, L5, L3, R1, L4, L5, R1, R3, L5, R1, L3, L2, L3, R2, R2, L3, L3
